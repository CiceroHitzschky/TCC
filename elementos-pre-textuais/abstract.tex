The measure theory is an extremely important subject for mathematics students, as it serves as the foundation for various areas of research such as Functional Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory, Probability, Statistics, among others. Considering that the undergraduate mathematics program has a strong emphasis on mathematics education, it becomes necessary to provide a consolidated way of presenting pure mathematics to students who wish to pursue this mathematical inclination in their postgraduate studies. Therefore, this project aims to demonstrate how a structure can be developed to meet this demand, focusing on addressing these students' needs through the study of $L^p$ spaces and their basic applications in functional analysis.
